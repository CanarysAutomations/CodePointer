# Code Pointer (Laser Pointer) 

### Presentation Mode (Laser Pointer) for Visual Studio Code

CodePointer brings the familiar **PowerPoint-style laser pointer** experience directly into VS Code.  
Perfect for live demos, trainings, workshops, and code walkthroughs.


## Why CodePointer?

When presenting code on screen shares, the default mouse cursor often:
- Gets lost in dark themes
- Distracts the audience
- Breaks the flow of explanation

CodePointer solves this by turning your cursor into a **high-visibility laser pointer**, making it easy to guide attention to the exact line or logic you’re discussing.

- **Dark Theme Optimized**

- **Lightweight & Zero Lag**  
  No performance impact during live coding or debugging.

-  **Presenter Ready**  
  Ideal for:
    - Technical demos  
    - GitHub Copilot trainings  
    - Workshops & bootcamps  
    - Conference talks  
    - YouTube / Twitch live coding
